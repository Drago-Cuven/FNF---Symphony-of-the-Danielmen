# WARNING THIS IS STILL A WIP
And you can't completely test this if you don't have access to the dev repository!

This is just public just to keep updated on my porting progress but since this modpack is getting developed through a dev version of the engine, you won't be able to fully play this modpack until the update comes out!

If you ignore this and test the modpack anyways well, I warned you! expected crashes and more!

# Info about this modpack
For avoiding to break any kind of mods, every V-Slice (aka, the FNF BaseGame) update since Week End 1 will be ported as an official modpack in this repo!
